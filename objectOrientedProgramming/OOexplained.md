So there's a big problem explaining object oriented programming to people that don't understand object oriented programming. This problem is really context (which I'll explain it a minute.) So I'm going to break up the explanation into a variety of pieces and revisit each piece from a different direction.


#here's the basic concept:

You have a noun. 

This noun is vague (purposely)... so that the things that describe it can be reused to explain other nouns that are more specific.

(Example: the noun Drug, or the noun Religion. There are many kinds of drugs and many kinds of religions.)

Using a vague noun to describe specific nouns makes it easier to describe the specific noun because you have a re-usable concept that can be used to explain many specific nouns. 

With that concept in hand some times the best way to explain a more specific noun is to say that its the vague noun except you remove something. These would be comparable to analogies. 

(example: a placebo is like a drug except it doesn't have any effects, or a deist is a person that believes in god but not formal dogmatic religion)

Other times the noun is two vague nouns combined, or you can take parts of the specific noun and use that to construct another new noun.

Thats the basic concept of Object Oriented Programming. Make things compartmentalized, reusable, flexible, and good at explaining.  


#How it is explained...

So when someone explains Object Oriented Programming it rarely is explained simply though. There are fancy words for each of the aforementioned concepts, and murky definitions of each one of the words. Here's why:

In addition to conceptual understanding of Object Oriented Programming, there is historical and conceptual implications that really make the definition what it is.

To me, and perhaps to normal laypeople, Object Oriented Programming is really just ​_the way programming should just be_​. It doesn't mean anything other than that. Reusable, flexible, semantic code is the way that code should be written... thus object oriented feels a lot like saying a newspaper article should use proper grammar. 

Now here's the reason why we needed to create: "Object Oriented Programming"...

Historically, programming started off in a much different place. Binary Programming, or programming based on primitives didn't have Objects (what I was calling "nouns" earlier). Early Programming was about numbers, not about how variable values interacted with each other. That layer of abstraction is important to modern programming and to formal logic. 

So its important that people understand that the interaction of objects (nouns) with each other is not a given within programming languages. Further more, Certain Languages (such as javascript and C) don't handle aspects of Object Orientation the same way as the languages that we call "Object Oriented". It is about nuance. 


#Explaining Object Oriented Programming again. 

So I gave you a conceptual overview... now I'm going to re-explain it except very specifically. Like everything else I will make sure to add a bunch of examples and as many analogies as I can. 

So what is an Object?

Though it's more complicated than this... it's a noun. An object is the name that we give to something that can be described using object notation.
