// 1. Before all else you should probably start with comments
//		a. Comments in javascript are part of the program that don't run
// 		b.There are two kinds of comments in Javascript:
//			i. Single Line Comments
//			ii. Multi Line Comments

// A Single line Comment is like this line right here. Two backslashes

/**************************************
***************************************
* A multi line comment looks like this.

/* or
This */

/*
* the important part of a multiline is actually that you start with "/*" and end with: */

/*
* Every line in between should have an asterisk. Like this "*"
*/


// Why start with comments?

// 1. its how to give instructions (like we're doing right now)
// 2. Comments will the most important way that you can learn from yourself in the future. Here's Master Foo's take on it:

/*
*	Master Foo and the Programming Prodigy
*
*	There was a time when rumors began to reach Master Foo and his students of a prodigiously gifted programmer, a young man who
*	wandered the length and breadth of the land performing mighty feats of coding and humiliating all who dared set their skill
*	against his.
*
*	Eventually this prodigy came to visit Master Foo, who received him politely and offered him tea. The Prodigy accepted with
*	equal politeness and explained the motive for his visit.
*
*	“I have come to you,” he said “seeking a code and design review of my latest project. For it is of surpassing complexity, and I
*	do not have peers capable of understanding it. Only an acknowledged master such as yourself (and here the Prodigy bowed deeply)
*	can have the discernment required.”
*
*	Master Foo bowed politely in return and began examining the Prodigy's code. After some time he raised his eyes from the screen.
*	“This code is at first sight very impressive,” he said. “It is elegant in design, utilizing original algorithms of great
*	ingenuity, and appears to be implemented in a craftsmanlike way which minimizes the possibility of errors.”
*
*	The Prodigy looked very pleased at this praise, but Master Foo continued: “However, I detect one significant flaw.”
*
*	“Flaw?” the Prodigy said. “What flaw?”
*
*	“This code is difficult to read,” said Master Foo. “It is only thinly commented, its invariants are not specified, and I see no
*	narrative description of its architecture or internal data structures anywhere. These problems will seriously impede your
*	cooperation with other programmers.”
*
*	The Prodigy drew himself up haughtily. “I do not seek the cooperation of other programmers,” he said. “Every time I thought I
*	had found one who might match me in skill I have been disappointed. Thus, I work alone.”
*
*	“But even the hacker who works alone,” said Master Foo, “collaborates with others, and must constantly communicate clearly to
*	them, lest his work become confused and lost.”
*
*	“Of what others do you speak?” the Prodigy demanded.
*
*	Master Foo said: “All your future selves.”
*
*	Upon hearing this, the Prodigy was enlightened.
