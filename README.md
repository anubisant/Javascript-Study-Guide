# Javascript-Study-Guide
a basic track for zero to hero in Javascript and full stack development

> "The Way" => Fundamentals(...not covered here), Language, Tools, Design Patters, Architecture, Skills

To become great: Solve problems well... in fact, solve them really well, be fast, teach others, 

So the basic track goes like this:

##  theBasics (see (Mezzofanti)[http://github.com/jppope/Mezzofanti] for core)

*	Comments
*	Data types(undefined, null, boolean, string, number, symbol)
* 	Variables & Contstants
*	Objects (more in OO)
*	logical operators
*	functions
*	Iteration => for/ foreach/ while
*	use of â€œthis"


## Normal Language Utilities

*	Traversing Data Structures (Array/JSON)
*	anonymous functions
*	Array manipulation
*	Math
*	Callbacks

## Object Oriented Programming

*	Overview
*	Prototypal 
*	Classical methods
* 	Constructor Methods
*	Classical
*	Classical methods

*	call back hell/ promises
*	Prototype
*	scope
*	closures / lambdas
*	bind

** Then putting it into practice **
underscores

Nodejs
     node in command line
     interaction with a database

Express
     routes
     http servers
koa
Vuejs
React
Titanium
Alloy

user authentication
Practical Application


**Lastly how to do the really cool stuff **
Design patterns,
when to use interfaces
when to use abstract classes
and whats best to use static functions


Conceptual understanding/ Guiding Principles
Creativity
