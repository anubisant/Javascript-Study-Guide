 The Big Lie
********************//*	

	
I want to start by identifying the biggiest lie that I came across when researching compressed learning:  

"everyone starts from scratch"

Through the vast majority of "systems" that I have researched and read about (especially when people are making claims as
to being able to do something in certain amount of time) no one ever identifies that we all start from different places.
If I've been working at IBM as a janitor, chances are that I'm going to run into more computer stuff than a clergyman... 
Even if I've never touched a computer for programming reasons.

The reason why I wanted to start by mentioning this is that with some of these people that have become great 
learners or have learned difficult skills quickly you never really know where they start. Anything worth learing is 
worth spending more time with than you will spend if you are on an accelorated learning schedule. Some methods are 
more efficient but less frequently used on a specific topic.

It's important that you don't get discouraged or demotivated. You may try and learn something in 6 months, but if it 
takes you eight, thats okay. These systems are just supposed to help you learn more and learn faster- I make no claim 
as to if this is the correct way to do things it is just a way to do things. As I have been frequently reminded the 
destination is the journey.
	
TODO:	
Theres a second half of this... kids are different than adults. (no kidding right?). Theres some things worth noting about it though... mental placticity is the only thing that's really a big deal. Yes there are critical time periods for learning language and other skills. It is very important

2.0 Planning Your Work
	1.1 Map Reduce- Planning your work
*******************************//*	
	
Intro:

Pretty much Every Source on compressed learning Isolates out that you need to map, reduce to unique+important values, build 
resources, make projections, and set goals all based on the mapping that you did. Basically know what you are going to do 
and when. Unfortunately there's a severe flaw with this logic in that you need to actually know something about what you are
planning out to do the planning. Thus the recommended path is iterative mapping:

/************************
2. Planning Your Work
	1.2 Iterative Mapping
**************************//*	

Iterative mapping is exactly what it sounds like... do not map everything all at once. Depending on subject complexity 
map out your activities in 3-5 iterations. 

How this goes:

1) Spend an hour doing loose research and writing down everything surface level that you might need to learn
2) Write out the things that appear to be the most important concepts (in outline form)
3) Write out your game plan (using the below techniques)
4) Execute on that game plan
5) Once you get about 70% of the way finished with that part of the knowledge base, then take the time to remap and plan how you are going to get through the information that you now know about

Think of it like this
Step #1- get your feet under you
Step #2- now that you know what this thing is about learn the entirety of the subject matter
Step #3 to Step #5- Once you are proficient, work on getting really good at it

I also recommend doubling back on each iteration and touching up with anything you might need more time on. Its a really good time to harden any knowledge that you might want to. The following are some techniques for use with iterative mapping:

My main motivational tactic is competition... I dont have a way to get competition in my world right now. The other challenge is how to motivate to stay focused. Especially without competition


	
	
Here’s an example I used for trying to understand photogrammetry.





Mapping and iterative mapping =>
most people that have studied learning recommend mapping out the project beforehand. This is smart. very smart. Only problem is. If you know literally nothing, how the hell are you going to map out 




You need a base. One of the things that I notice that all the authors skip is that they actually had solid bases of information and consumption of information. this shouldnt startle anyone. The fact is for someone to be self aware more than likely they learned enough for that to happen. As an example, Tim Ferriss may exadurate... but the guy got good enough grades to get into Princeton. I have done admissions, some people may sneak by for part of it, but most people just do the whole effing amount of work. 


Its funny how people that talk about learning fail to ever address knowledge bases that are not concrete. Sales is a perfect example of this. theres no textbooks. so called experts ususally use colloquial knowledge to build their programs. the thing is that you need to build your own curiculium


*********************

Things that do not work: Cramming


Making connections
Debugging errors
Connections are important because they provide an access point for understanding an idea. I struggled with the Fourier transform until I realized it was turning pressure to pitch or radiation to color. Insights like these are often making connections between something you do understand and the material you don’t.

Debugging errors is also important because often you make mistakes because you’re missing knowledge or have an incorrect picture. A poor understanding is like a buggy software program. If you can debug yourself in an efficient way, you can greatly accelerate the learning process.

Doing these two things, forming accurate connections and debugging errors, is most of creating a deep understanding. Mechanical skill and memorized facts also help, but generally only when they sit upon the foundation of a solid intuition about the subject.

THE DRILLDOWN METHOD: A STRATEGY FOR LEARNING FASTER

During the yearlong pursuit, I perfected a method for peeling those layers of deep understanding faster. I’ve since used it on topics in math, biology, physics, economics and engineering. With just a few modifications, it also works well for practical skills such as programming, design or languages.

Here’s the basic structure of the method:
Coverage
Practice
Insight



Stage One: Coverage

You can’t plan an attack if you don’t have a map of the terrain. Therefore the first step in learning anything deeply, is to get a general sense of what you need to learn.

For a class, this means watching lectures or reading textbooks. For self-learning it might mean reading several books on the topic and doing research.

A mistake students often make is believing this stage is the most important. In many ways this is the least efficient stage because the amount you can learn per unit of time invested is much lower. I often found it useful to speed up this part so that I would have more time to spend on the latter two steps.

If you’re watching video lectures, a great way to do this is to watch them at 1.5x or 2x the speed. This can be done easily by downloading the video and then using the speed-up feature on a player like VLC. I’d watch semester-long courses in two days, via this method.

If you’re reading a book, I would recommend against highlighting. This is processes the information at a low level of depth and is inefficient in the long run. A better method would be to take sparse notes while reading, or do a one-paragraph summary after you read each major section.

Here’s an example of notes I took while doing readings for a class in machine vision.

Stage Two: Practice

Practice problems are huge for boosting your understanding, but there are two main efficiency traps you can get caught in if you’re not careful.

#1 – Not Getting Immediate Feedback

The research is clear: if you want to learn, you need immediate feedback. The best way to do this is to go question-by-question with the solution key in hand. Once you’ve finished a question, check yourself against the provided solutions. Practice without feedback, or with delayed feedback, drastically hinders effectiveness.

#2 – Grinding Problems

Like the students who fall into the trap of believing that most learning occurs in the classroom, some students believe understanding is generated mostly from practice questions. While you can eventually build an understanding simply by grinding through practice, it’s slow and inefficient.

Practice problems should be used to highlight areas you need to develop a better intuition for. Then techniques like the Feynman technique, which I’ll discuss, handle that process much more efficiently.

Non-technical subjects, ones where you mostly need to understand concepts, not solve problems, can often get away with minimal practice problem work. In these subjects, you’re better off spending more time on the third phase, developing insight.

Stage Three: Insight

The goal of coverage and practice questions is to get you to a point where you know what you don’t understand. This isn’t as easy as it sounds. Often you can be mistaken into believing you understand something, but don’t, or you might not feel confident with a general subject, but not see specifically what is missing.

This next technique, which I call the Feynman technique is about narrowing down those gaps even further. Often when you can identify precisely what you don’t understand, that gives you the tools to fill the gap. It’s the large gaps in understanding which are hardest to fill.

The technique also has a dual purpose. Even when you do understand an idea, it provides you opportunities to create more connections, so you can drill down to a deeper understanding.

THE FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE

I first got the idea from this method from the Nobel prize winning physicist, Richard Feynman. In his autobiography, he describes himself struggling with a hard research paper. His solution was to go meticulously through the supporting material until he understood everything that was required to understand the hard idea.

This technique works similarly. By digesting the big hairy idea you don’t understand into small chunks, and learning those chunks, you can eventually fill every gap that would otherwise prevent you from learning it.



The technique is simple:

Get a piece of paper
Write at the top the idea or process you want to understand
Explain the idea, as if you were teaching it to someone else
What’s crucial is that the third step will likely repeat some areas of the idea you already understand. However, eventually you’ll reach a stopping point where you can’t explain. That’s the precise gap in your understanding that you need to fill.

From that gap, you can research the answer from a textbook, teacher or online. Generally, once you’ve narrowly defined your misunderstanding it becomes much easier to find the precise answer.

I’ve used this technique hundreds of times, and I’ve found it can tackle a wide variety different learning situations. However, since each might be slightly different, it may seem hard to apply as a beginner, so I’ll try to walk through some different examples.

For Ideas You Don’t Get At All

The way I handle this is to go through the technique but have the textbook open to the chapter explaining that concept. Then I go through and meticulously copy both the author’s explanation, but also try to elaborate and clarify it for myself. This “guided” Feynman can be useful when trying to write anything on your own would be impossible.

Here’s an example I used for trying to understand photogrammetry.

For Procedures

You can also use the method to fully understand a process you need to use. Go through all the steps and explain not only what they do, but how they execute it. I would often go through proof techniques by carefully explaining all the steps. I also used it in understanding chemical equations or in organizing the stages of glycolysis in biology.

You can see this example I used when trying to figure out how to implement grid acceleration.

For Formulas

Formulas should be understood, not just memorized. So when you see a formula, but can’t understand how it works, try walking through each part with a Feynman.


For Checking Your Memory

Feynmans also offer a way to self-test your knowledge of the big ideas for non-technical subjects. Being able to finish a Feynman on a topic without referencing the source material means you understand and can remember it.

Here’s one I did for an economics class, recalling the concept of predatory pricing.

DEVELOPING A DEEPER INTUITION

Combined with practice questions, the Feynman technique can peel those first few layers of understanding. But it can also drill deeper if you want to go from not just having an understanding, but to having a deep intuition.

Understanding an idea intuitively isn’t easy. Once again, getting to this point is often seen as a quasi-mystical process. But it doesn’t have to be. Most intuitions about an idea break down into one of the following types:

Analogies – You understand an idea by correctly recognizing an important similarity between it and an easier-to-understand idea.
Visualizations – Abstract ideas often become useful intuitions when we can form a mental picture of them. Even if the picture is just an incomplete representation of a larger, and more varied, idea.
Simplifications – A famous scientist once said that if you couldn’t explain something to your grandmother, you don’t fully understand it. Simplification is the art of strengthening those connections between basic components and complex ideas.
You can use the Feynman technique as a way of encouraging these types of insights. Once you’ve gotten past a basic understanding of the idea, the next step is to go further and see if you can explain it using some combination of the three methods above.

The truth is plagiarism is okay too, and not every insight needs to be unique. Understanding complex numbers as being two dimensional is hardly original, but it allows a useful visualization. DNA replication working like a one-way zipper is not a perfect analogy, but so long as you understand where it overlaps, it becomes a useful one.

The Strategy to Learn Faster

Learning faster doesn’t need to be a trick to work well. It simply means recognizing what is actually going on when we reach a new level of insight and finding tools to help us reach those stages consistently.

In this article I described learning as being three stages: coverage, practice and insight. This gives the false impression that these three occur always in distinct phases and never overlap or repeat.

In truth you may find yourself going between them in a loop as you successfully peel down to deeper layers of understanding. The first time you read a chapter you may get only superficial insights, but after doing practice questions and building intuitions, you may go back and read for deeper understandings.

Applying the Drilldown Method for Non-Students

This process isn’t one you need to be a student to apply. It also works for learning complex skills or building expertise on a topic.

For skills like programming or design, most people follow the first two stages. They read a book teaching them the basics, then they practice with a project. You can extend that process however, and use the Feynman technique to better lock in and articulate the insights you create.

For expertise on a topic, the only difference is that, prior to doing coverage, you need to find a set of material to learn from. That could be research articles or several books on the topic. In either case, once you’ve defined the chunk of knowledge you want to master, you can drill down and learn it deeply.


*****************************


I read lots of basic !tutorials, I dont try to deeply understand - too many pieces of the puzzle are missing, so I skim.
I try! to find some code examples that are very simple and very isolated and depend on no oth!er tool!s or! f!rame!works.
I !try !to fi!nd !complet!e, or larg!er !applicati!ons! tha!t are "doing it the right way"!, get! t!hem t!o r!un! and in!sta!ll,  poke !ar!ou!nd i!nside !and see h!ow the st!ru!ctur!e of! a l!arger !applicat!ion! ho!lds! to!ge!the!r.
I m!ig!ht! h!ave had s!ome! s!pecif!ic qu!estions or problems by this point so I post to the appropriate forum on reddit, or maybe email the author, or if I'm feeling masochistic, post a question to StackOverflow.
Essentially I aim to get one little thing to work - to make a chink in the armour of understanding. In this case for example I am aiming to get some data back from a web server and display it, and secondly to build an HTML form and POST it to the server.
I read the introduction documentation to how key related technologies work.  In this case obviously I have read introductions to react.js but it seems I also need to at least have a passing understanding of gulp and require and browserify and sass, so I fairly rapidly skim some intro documentation so I know how they fit into the picture and why they are there.

All during this process I am feeling frustrated and slow and unproductive. I have probably spent days achieving effectively nothing. If I was writing Python I would have been able to build almost a complete system.

One of the challenging aspects of this type of learning is that at the beginning of the process it's not even necessarily clear what you are trying to do.  So along the way, as things become more clear, I form mini-goals and aim for them. In this case for example one of my mini-goals is to buy a react.js based template and get it running standalone on a web server (sound easy?  yes it should be, but for a beginner it's HARD).

After getting some small thing to work, probably one or two pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place, at least a little bit.  It's now that I go back to the beginning and repeat the cycle.  Right back to the start.  Re-read all those introductions, go back through all the code samples and re-do all the learning. In this second pass things should start to make alot more sense. Several lightbulbs should switch on. You will realise that the stuff you read previously already explained details that you missed, puzzles to solve, strange concepts and things you have been wondering about - it's just that the first time around you didn't have enough frame of reference to tie it all in to.

And all the time you need to be trying to get yourself in a position to write code.  Trying to get enough understanding to do a bit of coding.  Understanding only truly comes from coding with real purpose.  The objective of the reading and digging about is to get you to the code.

As mentioned before I like to write small isolated code samples at first, but ideally I am looking for a larger open source code base that already does something similar to what I am trying to do, and I want to work within it.  It's MUCH easier to grasp a new development technology from within a codebase that actually makes it work. Paradoxically it is also much harder because you have been dropped in the deep end, but that is a necessary part of the path of learning.

When faced with learning a new technology I feel some sense of dread.  There's always a temptation to not learn the technology that you know would be the best one to know if the long run, but instead learn something simpler and easier.  Don't take that path - you'll just end up knowing the wrong technology and still not have moved towards deep understanding of the right technology.

So that is how I learn a new technology. It's frustrating and feels unproductive but deeply necessary.  To be a programmer in 2015 you need to competence with many types of technology and expertise with a few too. If you avoid this then you will not be able to get the stuff built that you need to.

Even if you have attained enlightenment with some technology you will still be constantly repeating smaller iterations of this process as you learn new details about languages and frameworks, it never ends but hopefully becomes easier and faster.

You're going to need to repeat this learning process over and over and over so you may as well recognise the pattern of frustration through to enlightenment.

It's VERY hard at first but it doesn't stay hard forever - work hard at getting through the initial beginner phase to competence.

It's the enlightenment stage that I look forward to - that's when programming becomes fun and the computer becomes your canvas upon which to paint your ideas and inspiration.

Follow a tutorial step-by-step even if you don’t always understand what you’re doing. I like to think of Hunter S. Thompson copying the books of the Great Masters on his typewriter. You’re getting a feel for how things are done in your new language/framework. This part should be easy, if boring, because you’re just doing what you’re told. [Incline of Optimism]
Rebuild the thing you just made or a slight variation of it. Try not to use the tutorial too much. Realize just how little you understood of what you were doing. [Fear tugs, slowing your ascent]
Try to build something simple that you actually want to make. Discover that you have absolutely no idea what you’re doing. [Sea of Despair]
Find a new tutorial related to your new project. (Hopefully your tutorials are providing you with increasing background on the language.) Follow the steps. [Slight sense of understanding, rise in self-worth]
Rebuild the thing yourself. [Fear]
Start a new project. [Despair]

PIETER GYSELINCK


The basics is that you have to use it to reach a certain goal. By working on a taks, you will stumble on a lot of the basic issues which should get you going to learn. Connecting the dots is something I mostly do while working on a goal. That is the moment to call in tutorials and books. With Laravel e.g. I have a development going and new goals are added week by week. These new goals push me automatically to certain chapters to learn. Alas, there are a lot of systems around which are poor documented. The main error I see is that they always lack basics to learn you work with the available high-brow documentation. This is a typical teaching error where documenters jump to conclusions to fast expecting the public to be experienced. Wrong


ANTONIN JANUSKA
A little late to the game (I think?) but I feel like I have a pretty damn good system. And the results show it. Hell, I’m writing a book on it :)

Dogfooding

I think I got the term right but basically, whenever you learn something new, whether it’s language (programming or not), methodology, system, or a new concept, make sure that you can find something selfish about it, something that you can use for yourself right away.

For instance, I’m learning music !production and the first thing I’m trying to do is get a simple beat/sample that I can run at the beginning of my youtube videos. I’m also learning React, I’m bu!ilding a simple dashboard using HabitRPG API because their AngularJS interface is so complicated that it can’t run well on my Windows Phone browser.

Split it up into “daily” and “monthly” goals

Ever heard of NaNoWriMo? It’s a month where you write 1700 or so words a day to complete a Novel at the end. I split up my learning like that. When I was learning the aforementioned Music production, I set up a monthly goal (4-5 songs) and a daily goal (a beat or a progression of a song). This kept up a simple slow but powerful pace. I believe that you can learn the basics of anything using that methodology. I even wrote a long-ass article about it.

Also, when I say basics, what I really mean is an intro into a concept. For example, if you’ve got PHP down, OOP PHP basics don’t take that long. Once you got that down, working with specific frameworks doesn’t take long either. And so on. There are always “basics” of something, like I’m sure there are the “basics” of Rocket Engineering (which might involve gibberish none of us understand).

Many technologies don’t take that long

Teach

A couple of years ago, I gave a presentation introducing AngularJS to a roomful of Javascript beginners. I wouldn’t say I was a beginner but I was barely intermediate. Having to approach the presentation from the point of view of an absolute beginner was tough but rewarding. After the presentation, I rewrote it as an article, amending it with all that I’ve learned and gotten from the Q&A and just presenting in general.

I did the same thing with React, even with HTML !and CSS back in the day when I was learning it. It’s super helpful because in trying to explain it, you’re forced to simplify the most difficult parts of the topic rather than treating it like a black box. Think of it as a different form of rubber duck debugging with an audience (or without, just get that damn rubber duck)

Pay attention to the A-ha moments

People like to compare those moments to that synaptic “click” in your head where things suddenly make sense, or moving around pieces of a puzzle until it connects to the right hole. I like to say that it’s like revving up the RPM in a core until it shifts. Because when it shifts, you’re on your way to going faster and further with your learning.

What’s great about the A-ha moments is that once you see how they happen, you can teach yourse!lf how to learn new stuff pr!operly by getting to that A-ha moment as quickly as possible. It’s a way to understand yourself and your mind.

Anyways, good luck :)

Nick Edwards

I need to have a distinct purpose to learn something. For example: I was heavily incentivized to learn front-end code so that I would be considered for my position at ZURB. I took three weeks and spent 10 hours a day figuring out how to !do basic stuff and then was duly rewarded with the full day interview followed by position (super awesome btw).

Without ince!ntive I find it much harder to just learn faster. I tend to work better under pressure when I need t!o perform though. I do understand that it’s not the best method for everyone.

Bill Tran

Being consistent and doing it until you learn it. Most people don’t learn quickly because they aren’t consistent with learning. Reference is also good too. I think having all the available reference on the subject makes a big difference too. I usually try to get as much reference as I can, whether it’s classes, books, video, or knowledgable people. Having a project to work on. This is a big one, I couldn’t learn anything quickly unless I had a project to work on. I would recommend the ‘The First 20 Hours’ and “The 4 Hour Chef’. Both these books talk about the theory of learning things quickly and have good examples to walk you through their process. If you have reference, a good project to work on, and motivation you can learn anything quickly.


DANIEL CODELLA
I think the best way to learn anything is to just start trying to do it. You’ll quickly run into the pitfalls, get a sense of the mechanics of whatever it is and learn a few of the idiosyncrasies of the mechanisms or process.

This knowledge of what will go wrong, what weird problems will come up, what parts you will encounter over and over is learning what you don’t know. And I know it sounds silly, but you need to know what you don’t know, in order to understand something effectively.

I always wanted to learn audio recording software.

Read tons of books on the subject. But when I was finally put in front of a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), I was suddenly faced with all of these small issues the books hadn’t covered or didn’t cover in the early section. When I clicked on the timeline, the cursor didn’t snap to the beginning of each measure, something critically important for making sure your clips all start at the same time I learned later this was called “Snap to grid”, but just casually reading, I didn’t realize how important it was, even though it’s something you encounter immediately


I decided then to just start tooling around, and I quickly learned what I would NEED to learn to really start going. I began to know what I didn’t know. I realized I needed to understand this timeline in and out to record, edit or play audio. I realized I needed to understand my audio interface and my input/ou!tput settings. I realized that things I THOUGHT would be important, like effects didn’t really matter until I was done recording.

In this way, I was able to prioritiz!e my learning and make fast progress. I think it kinda applies to everything in life. You need to just jump in, fail a bit, so you can can figure out what exactly you need to learn, and then start from there.

Mastering searching is super important. There’s a good infographic here. Also, interact and contribute to the community - whatever community it is. People like to help people, so just ask the right people the right questions.

A combination of being relentless, googling and tweeting. When learning any new technology I end up spending lots of time searching for how to articles and posts trying to achieve something similar. Learn the proper term for something then re-google, tweet to your community for support and keep at it even if it takes time.

And use lynda.com…



HOW TO STUDY BASED ON HOW MEMORY WORKS

Memory works (to put it simply) in 3 stages: attention, encoding (storing/associating with other info), andretrieval (remembering)

To optimize the final stage, you have to optimize the first two stages. This means you have to pay attention to the material, and you have to encode it well. (Which I'll explain below.) Additionally, if you repeat the process, you reinforce it. By retrieving something, you start to pay attention to it again, and then you are able to re-encode it better than before.

To optimize encoding, remember GOAT ME.

G is generate and test. i.e., quiz yourself, or otherwise come up with the answers on your own without just reading them. Even if you get it wrong, it helps more than if you just read the answer off the bat, because you're forcing yourself to think more about it (why was it wrong?). Test yourself in a way that will resemble what you'll actually have to do during the real test. (e.g., if you have to write essays on the test, instead of just writing and memorizing bullet points, actually write an essay multiple times without cheating, review it, and repeat until you can write it without forgetting any important points.) Other effective ways of testing yourself are teaching the material to someone else and talking about it out loud to yourself.

O is organize. This reduces the load on your brain and helps create reminders just by coloring, position, or associations with nearby material. For instance, a time line helps remember that event A came before event B in history, not necessarily because you memorized the dates but because you organized the info so that event A was written earlier and you happen to remember that it was written earlier. The position of the information becomes meaningful. You can organize with outlines, pictures, color coding, related material, etc. My use of "GOAT ME" can be thought of as organization. Another fun example (chunking) is as follows. Which of these seems easier to memorize: "CIAFBIKGBCNNUSABBCUK" or "CIA FBI KGB CNN USA BBC UK"?

A is for avoid illusions of learning. There are two kinds of memory: familiarity/recognition and recall. Recall is what you want. That's where you can remember the information on your own, as you might be expected to do on a test. Recognition is where you can't think of it on your own but if you see it you suddenly remember it. That's not good. You won't necessarily see it on your test, so you won't get a blatant reminder of it. Avoid study methods that rely on recognition. Similarly, a major problem with rereading material is "fluency". The more you read it, the easier reading it becomes, and when it feels easier to read, you assume you have learned it. You have not. You've just become more skilled at reading it. Don't bother highlighting your textbook in the first go either. You feel like you're picking out the important parts of the chapter but you can't know what's really important until you've read the whole thing. And then all you're gonna do anyway is go back and reread all the highlights, and as we've established, rereading is useless. If instead you actually organize the highlights and quiz yourself on them, highlighting may be useful. For a similar reason, rewriting information is also not very helpful unless you use it as a method of quizzing.

T is take breaks. This is HUGE. If nothing else, walk away with just this tip. Your memory works best if you study in frequent, short sessions rather than one long cram session. You don't give your brain a chance to store the earlier info you studied, so it just slips out of your mind, and you'll have wasted your time studying it. So study for awhile, go do something else for a bit, and come back to it, and repeat. One of my students said she taped information in front of her toilet so whenever she went to pee or something she could study for just a couple minutes. It sounds strange but it's actually a great idea (I'd advise, in line with G and A that you tape questions in front of the toilet and tape answers elsewhere so you can quiz yourself.) Another important part of this is that you need to sleep to keep that info in your head. Even if you take regular breaks, an all nighter will do more harm than good. Your memories are stored more permanently after sleep. This is just how the brain works. You can even try to work naps into your study sessions. It's a break + sleep [EDIT: I do not know how long breaks SHOULD be, but I believe this varies from person to person. Just try to study over the course of days instead of hours.]

M is match learning and testing conditions. This is based off the principle of encoding specificity, which states that, if you want to optimize memory, then the conditions surrounding encoding (e.g., where you are when you study, how tired you are when you study, etc.) should be the same as those surrounding retrieval (!e.g., where you are when you're tested, how tired you are when you're tested, etc.). This is because the conditions themselves serve as reminders. (Have you ever walked into the kitchen for something, forgotten why you were there, and as soon as you return to the other room you suddenly remember why you went to the kitchen?) This includes your environment and your physiology, serving as reminders. Think about noise level, size of room, lighting, types of furniture, mood, intoxication, sitting position, and even the way you work with the material (remember G and A). Studies show that learning while drunk is best remembered while drunk again. Learning after exercising, also best remembered after exercising. The alternative to this is that you should study under MANY different conditions. This way, the information comes easily to you regardless of your surrounding conditions. Otherwise, the information will unfortunately be associated with the specific circumstances you studied under and will be difficult to remember in any other situation. If you want to remember this stuff outside of being tested in class, STUDY UNDER MANY CONDITIONS. Study in a noisy place AND a quiet place, with and without coffee, etc.

E is elaborate. Think deeply about the material and make other associations with it. At the most extreme, this can mean truly understanding the concept, why it works, how it relates to other concepts, and how it's applied. But on a simpler level, it can be the following: Does it remind you of something else? Can you make a song out of it? Can you visually imagine it? How does it apply to you or your life? Instead of taking the material at face value, do something with it. The reason this is important is because of reminders. Memory works by having a network of associations. One thing reminds you of another. If you've thought deeply about it, you've probably associated it with something else in memory, which can then serve as a reminder. You can think, "Oh yeah, this is the term that inspired me to draw that silly stick figure to represent it. And I remember what the drawing looked like so now I remember what the term means." Additionally, the quality of the memory will be better if you have elaborated on it. Elaboration allows for a lot of creativity and individuality among studiers. Choose whichever method of elaboration works for you. Maybe you enjoy making up songs, drawing doodles, creating stories, visually imagining it, relating it to yourself, or just pondering about it. If you're studying history, you might try to think about it visually, imagine what people would have said or looked like, watch them in your head doing their historical stuff, or maybe you'd like to draw a quick doodly comic about a particular event, or maybe you wanna think about why this even was significant, or how it relates to another historical event.

If I had to summarize this in fewer points:

Keep similar conditions during studying and testing. This includes environmental surroundings, mental and physiological state, the way you think about the material, and so on. But if you want to remember this outside of class, study in a VARIETY of conditions, so that you don't associate the material with any particular condition.

Study briefly and frequently, and sleep.

But one other good point I would add is this:

Take notes BEFORE class if possible, and add to them whenever necessary. Do this by reading the textbook chapters ahead of time (and take notes; refer to your syllabus to find out which chapter is next, if applicable) or see if your teacher posts Powerpoints online ahead of time. This way, you're not just frantically writing notes in class and you'll actually be able to more fully pay attention to what the teacher is saying (remember: attention is the first step of the memory process). You may think you can pay attention to the professor as you're writing, but you are actually dividing your attention and hurting your memory.
EDIT: Whoa, thanks for all the comments, the gold, and the upcoming pizza(s) I'm trying to get to those who've asked questions, but my inbox has exploded, so sorry if I take awhile I will try to edit as people offer other good points, but I'm already super close to the character limit Trying to cut it down now.

https://medium.com/life-learning/the-one-learning-technique-that-scared-the-heck-out-of-bruce-lee-b88ec2971020


There’s two ways to learn: passively and aggressively.

Passively is when you study your mistakes, read the history of what you are learning, network, find your “tribe”, find a mentor, etc.

Aggressively is right when you are in the middle of it. You’re neck deep and the ball is coming at you: what do you do?

Passively is in your head. Aggressively is noticing RIGHT NOW and taking action.

In your head is important. But ACTION is what creates heroes.

THE BRUCE LEE TECHNIQUE

Bruce Lee said, “I don’t fear the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks. I fear the man who practiced one kick 10,000 times.”

Mollie was having trouble using her backhand to return a serve.

So I bought 200 tennis balls and had her stand on the left side of the court. I served 200 times to the left side of the left box.

Over and over. We didn’t rally. As soon as she hit back I served the next ball. Maybe a little harder or with more spin.

She returned maybe 5% of them and started crying. “I’m horrible!” she said.

“Don’t worry,” I told her. “Your brain is what learned today but your body learns when you sleep.”

So yesterday we did it again. Now she returned about 60% of the balls. She was smiling the whole time. “I got better!” she said.

“Don’t worry,” I told her. “You’re going to get worse also.”

“Don’t be sad when you fail and be happy when you succeed. Both are going to happen again and again at every new level.”

If we had just played games, she never would’ve gotten enough experience using her backhand to return a serve. Now she’s learning what she needs to learn.

When I was learning chess, my instructor would put two pawns and a rook on the board versus his rook and told me to try and beat him.

Then he put the two pawns in a different part of the board. Then a different part of the board. For four hours just two pawns and a rook versus a rook.

Did I learn how to win with a rook and two pawns? Maybe.

But I also learned a little more of the subtleties of what a rook is good for. Or which pawns might be ever so slightly more important than other pawns. Or the power of the king when few pieces are on the board. Of the power of my brain calculating many moves ahead when only a few pieces are on the board.

Sunlight doesn’t just hit you. When you open the window the sunlight hits everything in your house.

When you open the window of learning, you don’t learn just the specific thing you are trying to see. You begin to see everything that is now lit.

The real art is paying attention to all of the things you can now see. Now that the sunlight is pouring in.

When I dropped Mollie off she said, “I had fun.” And she said, “I love you Daddy”.

I woke up at 1 in the morning last night and I had an idea for a post. I reached for my pad and pen but I fell out of bed and onto the floor. “Ow!” The pad was gone.

So I went downstairs and typed the four parts of the post into the computer. It was about “4 techniques for Aggressive Learning”.

I wrote down the techniques and sent it to myself via email.

What I wrote down:

“BRUCE LEE TECHNIQUE
TONY ROBBINS TECHNIQUE
THE MODIFY TECHNIQUE
COACH YOUR FUTURE SELF”

I sort of forget now what the fourth one means.

And I’ve already taken up enough space with the first one so I’ll do the other three some other time. Maybe.

When you have an idea you have to write it down IMMEDIATELY.

I usually say, “I’ll remember in the morning.”

Not once in my life have I remembered anything in the morning.

Even now, I don’t fully remember what I meant and I have the email right in front of me.

When you get a “mental download” you have to:

Save it
Write it
Teach it to someone else
As quickly as possible. Else you will forget it.

For instance, many people write me and say, “I can’t remember anything I read in a book.”

That’s natural. You have to read it. Then teach it to someone else. Then THE NEXT DAY teach it to someone else.

That’s the only way to learn what is in the book.

After serving other 200 times to Mollie yesterday, I don’t really care whether she learned or not. (“I love you Daddy”).

All I know is: By the time we were done I learned how to serve better.

/* Tony Robbins Method*/
G) THE TONY ROBBINS METHOD.
In the interview I said, Ok, I figured it out. You use "the Tony Robbins Method'". Which I defined as,
1. at first you dont know anything
2. you find 5 people who are the experts in the world
3. you extensively interview them
4. you figure out the most simple things they have in common with each other
5. you do that simple thing over and over and over and over (repetition)
And thats how you succeed.
